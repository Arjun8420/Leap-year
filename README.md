# Leap-year
This is a program to check the input is a leap year or not using if else loop
Here i have used one if else, two if else and three if else loop to find the leap year

Logic
1. if a year is not divisible by 4, its not a leap year
2. if a year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, its a leap year
3. if a year is divisible by 4 and 100 then it should be divisible by 400 to be a leap year
